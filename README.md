## My process

I used CSS Grid along with Flexbox for this project. I was initially thinking of breaking each individual
component into grids as well, but the layout without it was according to the design. Might do it later though. Right now, only the container is setup as grid layout - vertically for mobile screens, horizontally for desktop screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid for this.

### Continued development

Might setup individual components as Grid as well. This project is subject to changes as and when feedback is received.
